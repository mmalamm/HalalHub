Today, the Halal Truck in New York city is as iconic as the Hot Dog Stand was in the 80's. HalalHub is a full-stack web application inspired by Yelp which seeks to create a repository of information regarding the many Halal trucks around New York City. It uses a Ruby on Rails API on the backend with a PostgreSQL database, and React/Redux architectural framework on the frontend.
